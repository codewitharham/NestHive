# NestHive

NestHive is an inclusive platform that bridges publishers and users, facilitating the sharing and exploration of a wide array of digital assets. Whether you're interested in music samples, UI components, recipes, or educational resources, NestHive offers a centralized hub for discovery and collaboration.

## Features

- **Diverse Content Sharing**: Publishers can upload various digital assets, including music samples, UI components, recipes, and learning materials.
- **User Engagement**: Users can browse, like, share, and download collections, fostering an interactive community.
- **Content Management**: Publishers have the flexibility to manage their content, choosing to make it public or private based on their preferences.

## Installation

To set up NestHive locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codewitharham/NestHive.git
   cd NestHive
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd Backend
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd Frontend/my-app

   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the frontend application:

     npm start
     ```

By default, the frontend runs on `http://localhost:3000` and communicates with the backend server on `http://localhost:5000`.
